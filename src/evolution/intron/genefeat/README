1. I first estimated the gamma distribution parameters:
alpha (shape), lambda (rate) with the Moment method.

This is done for each number of exons per gene
Some genomes do not have enough data so that the parameters are not estimated.
I have to estimated it somehow with curves.

2. I also mnaully estimated a subset of the parameters with MLE method.

The result will be written to a file: gamma_param_exlen.tab
