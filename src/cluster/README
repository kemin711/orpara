I am only adding these very old not useful source code to the
git for historical reasons.
Most of them are not useful. Only hatrees.h may be a little useful
All otherse are too specialized and use libpq++.h which may not
be available now


A dumy database will constructed from dumy strings, so that when
using input from file a disfunctional PgDatabase object will be 
created this will solve the problem of non-public default constructor
problem when database is not used.

====================================================================
I modified the default constructor from PgDatabase to be
public to construct empty databases. 

You have to modify the /usr/lcoal/pgsql/include/libpq++.h
file for this program to compile.  

I will modify this program in the future to remove PgDatabase
from the member list of the clusmethod object.  It should be passed
as an argument.

dumpclusterprt dumps protein sequences from sameas relationship
the other dump programs dumps the final cluster protein into separate
clusters for multiple sequence alignment

The java program needs to be modified to new database schemas.

chimer headers:

Result written to: split.tab with column headers:
 seqid  seqlen  min_begin       max_end avg_begin       avg_end n       avg_score    avg_ngidentity   avg_coverage    median_coverage

** running the chimera detection program

For Lacbi1, Necha1

kzhou@durian:~/proj/cluster$ ./chimeradetect_mysql -a modelaln -t alnchimera -r alnsplit -d Lacbi1 -h frylock --taxids "29883,2765,76867" --chimera-tab chimera_prt_candidate --split-tab split_candidate --ngCut 0.36 --idenCut 0.34 --chimera_covCut 0.4 --split_covCut 0.35

(1) Needs to increate the identity cut 
	--ngCut 0.4
	--idenCut 0.38
	--chimera_covCut 0.6
	--split_covCut 0.5

Somehow I have used the postgres database for data source and this 
has been build into some binaries.  For the C++ interface I have
use the old more thinner wrapper around the C API.  This is much 
faster than the new C++ API which is much more complicated.  Because
I have only used a few functions from the C++ API it is not 
worth to switch to the new API.

I am using the libpq++-4.0 package
on top of 
and postgresql-8.1.3

When system is updated this package should be recompiled
because the dynamic linking to libstdc++ will conflict.

This package can be compiled on any 32 bits machine at JGI.

chimera checking programs.
I have a chimera program in /proj/range that is more useful.
It only needs a half-alignment table

New changes
I have updated both mysql interface and the libpqxx so that
it will be up to date.  I quickly went through the code
and made modification that just compiled.  It is likely
that it will cause segmentation fault becuase I did not
carefully initialize some variables.
