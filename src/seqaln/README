src/seqconv/fishing.cpp is an example of using the new template version 
of dynaln.t.h
No need for linking.

Replacing the dynaln with the template version. The header file is now
dynalnt.h, and there is no cpp file with it. Everything is just template.

Matrix is replaced with scorematrix.  Now the ScoreMethod has several different
kinds. This provides with the dynaln class the compile time polymorphism
through templates.


This directory contains my own implementation of the dynamic alignment
algorithm both global and local are implemented.  I also implemented the
linear memory version.

Testing and is still needed.

The strategy is to write specialized program for different 
purposes using the same libraries.

dbaln is suited for chimera detections.
dbaln_cds is suited for genewise cds self alignment step.

mysql connection with the C++ native interface has always 
caused problems. The main problem is the dynamic linking
with *.so libraries.  First it is the problems of different
kind of machines.  I should have two sets of libraries for
different kinds of machines. Then the location of the 
mysql++.so should be forced somehow.
