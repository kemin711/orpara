What's New:

Version 2.0: Coming in 1997.
             Added SHELL=/bin/sh in Makefiles for SGI's
             Added conservative subsititions, printed as `:' in alignment
             First sequence file can now contain a database of FASTA sequences.
             Added xlate() routine to translate nucleotides to proteins.
             Added simplified load_seq() for standalone apps: load_seq_lite().
             Added P-value self-repeat programs: pvsrlocalS, mpvsrlocalS.
             Reports empty sequence files and empty substitution matrix errors.
             Reverse-complements second sequence now, rather than the first.
             Small changes made to facilitate running through our web server,
                http://www-hto.usc.edu/software/seqaln/seqaln-query.html
             Fixed problem with tandem repeat alignments using linear mode.

Version 1.16: July 1996.
             Supports BLAST-format penalty matrices from the NCBI.
             Loads p-value distribution files again.

Version 1.15: June 1996.
             Modified make files to work with Gnu make.
             HTML versions of the man pages, cross-linked to each other,
                are now available: see seqaln-1.15/doc/html.
             Added standalone utility programs to convert Genbank, PIR and
                Swissprot to FASTA format, for universal handling of databases.
                Note: these are not fully tested -- watch for version 1.2.
             Added structure elements in seqaln.h to handle multiple sequences
                (e.g., from a mini-database).
             Added linear memory model, keeping 2 rows of score matrix
                (declumping and tracebacks not available with linear model).
             Added separate routine for profile score matrix printing.
             Added rpt_row() routine to print one row of scoring matrix.
             Moved matrix printing into score matrix loop, for linear support.
             Replaced indexing the scoring matrix by subscripts with pointers.
             Tandem repeat score output now contains score's # of wraparounds.
             Maintained identical output to Version 1.0 for old flags,
                except with improved tandem repeat reporting.
             Changed seqaln-1.15/test/Makefile to test square & linear models.

             New flags supported:
                +L  perform computations with linear-space scoring matrix.
                -L  same as +L.

Version 1.1: January 1996.
             Sequence files in the Pearson/FASTA format are now supported.
             A fifth main structure, io, has been added to hold stdout, stderr.

             New flags supported:
                -Ofile  sends stdout to file, truncated.
                +Ofile  appends stdout to file.
                -Efile  sends stderr to file, truncated.
                +Efile  appends stdout to file.
                        Note: errors from memory allocation are still
                              printed to stderr.
                +V      prints version # of programs.
                -V      turns off printing version #.

             INCDIR added to Makefile for location of include files.
             The call to anint(x) was replaced with a call to floor(x+0.5).
             `inline' was changed to `INLINE' wherever it appeared.
             If alpha == beta, E and F scoring matrices are not used.
             All demo programs print errors to stderr.
             Matrix, profile and distribution files may be loaded with or
                without the suffixes `.mat', `.pro' or `.dis', respectively.
             The revcomp() routine now calls two routines in revcomp.c:
                a routine to reverse a sequence, and a routine to complement
                a sequence; there is still just one flag, `-r', for
                reverse complement but one or the other can be had with
                custom software.
             Variables reverse, complement, and revcomp have been added to
                the SEQALN_SEQUENCE data structure to denote the state of
                the sequence being used vs. the original sequence.  This
                appears on output as rev(seqname), comp(seqname), or
                revcomp(seqname).

Version 1.0: The first release.
